# Example of a `CODEOWNERS` file

# These people are the default owners for everything in the repo.
*       @default-owner

# Order is important. The last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# This means @doc-owner will be requested for review when changes are
# made to any files under docs/
/docs/  @doc-owner

# You can also specify email addresses if they are associated with a GitHub account.
